### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.image_section{
    background-color:hsl(277, 64%, 61%) ;
    background-image: url(images/image-header-desktop.jpg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    background-blend-mode: multiply;
  }
```
I found setting image most challenging .

In mobile design there are many problems especially in image . 
Much work is there in Mobile responsive Area
